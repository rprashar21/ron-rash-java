  3. You need to add code at line PC26 of Processing.cs to ensure that security policies are met.
  Box 1: var key = await Resolver.ResolveKeyAsyn(keyBundle,KeyIdentifier.CancellationToken.None);
  Box 2: var x = new BlobEncryptionPolicy(key,resolver);
  Example:
  // We begin with cloudKey1, and a resolver capable of resolving and caching Key Vault secrets.
  BlobEncryptionPolicy encryptionPolicy = new BlobEncryptionPolicy(cloudKey1, cachingResolver);
  client.DefaultRequestOptions.EncryptionPolicy = encryptionPolicy;
  Box 3: cloudblobClient. DefaultRequestOptions.EncryptionPolicy = x;
