Strengths of the Current Implementation
HikariCP Usage: HikariCP is known for its high performance and low overhead, making it an excellent choice for connection pooling. Itâ€™s optimized for low latency and high throughput.
Thread-Safe Pool Management: The use of ConcurrentHashMap for VIEW_POOLS, VIEW_WRITABLE_POOLS, EVENT_POOLS, and EVENT_PROCESSOR_POOLS ensures thread-safe access to connection pools, which is critical in a multi-threaded environment.
Lazy Initialization: The computeIfAbsent method ensures that HikariDataSource instances are created only when needed, reducing unnecessary resource allocation.
Configurable Pool Sizes: The getPoolSize method allows for dynamic configuration of pool sizes via system properties, with sensible defaults (20) if invalid values are provided.
Error Handling: The createDataSource method includes logging and exception handling, which aids in debugging and monitoring.
Context-Based Connection Pools: The separation of pools by context and store type (viewstore, eventstore, etc.) allows for fine-grained control and isolation, which can prevent contention and improve scalability.
SSL Support: The inclusion of sslmode in the JDBC URL suggests attention to security, which is important for production environments.


Here are the key points for your presentation on API Test Performance Issues and Improvements:
Current Performance Issues:
Long Wait Times
2-3 minute timeouts in tests
