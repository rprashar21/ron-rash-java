Api Integration Tests actas as a client to test the  acts as a client to those APIs and verifies their behavior.

Build Lifecycle
maven-failsafe-plugin: This is key. Failsafe is designed for running integration tests (unlike Surefire, which is for unit tests).
Your configuration uses it heavily:
It's configured within multiple <profiles> (api-test, api-test-smoke, etc.).
Each profile typically activates Failsafe to run a specific subset of tests (using <includes> and <excludes>).

exec-maven-plugin: This plugin is used to run specific Java classes during the build lifecycle
(pre-integration-test and post-integration-test).
You're using it to run SetupIntegrationTests before the Failsafe tests run and TeardownIntegrationTests afterwards.
 This indicates complex setup/teardown logic (e.g., priming databases, creating users, setting up test data
 , cleaning up afterwards) that goes beyond simple @Before/After annotations.

 As identified previously, the main remaining bottleneck is polling (both HTTP and DB waits)
 within the test code itself (CourtsAbstractTest, RestClientUtil, DBHelper).


What the Command Does:
It connects to the remote server DEVCCMSLAVE01.cpp.nonlive via SSH.
The -L 5425:psf-dev-ccm05-supporting.postgres.database.azure.com:5432 part tells SSH:
"Listen on port 5425 on my local machine. Any traffic that comes to this port should be securely forwarded through the DEVCCMSLAVE01.cpp.nonlive server,
 and then sent to the host psf-dev-ccm05-supporting.postgres.database.azure.com on port 5432."

Database Location: Your integration tests need to connect to various databases to verify data, check preconditions, or set up test states.
The hostname psf-dev-ccm05-supporting.postgres.database.azure.com clearly indicates a PostgreSQL database hosted on Azure,
 specifically the one for the "supporting" context (likely holding data for material, notification, documentqueue, etc.) in the ccm05 DEV environment.
 Port 5432 is the standard PostgreSQL port.
