Lets start with a sample examle of
user job userjob info -- these are my entities

What are my entities?
how do they map with each other?
What constraints matter?
Email & username must be unique.
salary > 1000, hire_date > birthday (business rules).

UserEntity--> attributes{}
JobEntity--> attribtes

Draw a quick UML or ERD for clarity:
UserAccount ─< UserJob >─ Jobs
        │
        └── has one Info record

2.Schema Design & Choice of Database
Do we need rdbms or no sql database
since user jobs jobinfo can have relationship we will go for  rdbms
Why PostgreSQL?

ACID compliance & strong FK support
Rich datatypes (e.g. TIMESTAMP, UUID, JSONB)
Mature JDBC driver and Spring Data support
Scales well for both reads and writes
You’d keep your DDL much as you have it, perhaps tweaking for UUID PKs or adding indexes later.
