no sql -- will have key value pair -- like documents ,mongodb,cassandra,Dynamodb,redis
sql - relational dbs -- mysql{oracl} postgresql

rdbms - there is
Tier 1 (Single-Tier Architecture): The database and application are on the same system.
Tier 2 (Two-Tier Architecture): The application and database are separate, directly connected via a network.
Tier 3 (Three-Tier Architecture): Divides into three parts: user interface, logic and database, all working together.

Entity relationship is a conceptual model for designing a databases
logical structure for our databse , defining entties and relationships between them
Er model -- entities - logical strucute of the database -- orm object relation mapping
Entity: An objects that is stored as data such as Student, Course or Company.
Attribute: Properties that describes an entity such as StudentID, CourseName, or EmployeeEmail.
Relationship: A connection between entities such as "a Student enrolls in a Course".

ER Diagrams -> These diagrams serve the purpose of real-world modeling of objects which makes them intently useful

Types of entity
Strong Entity --> entity with a primary key -- strongly
Weak entity --> cannot exisit on it own --does nt have a primary key
An employee {strong entity} in a comapny has dependents{weak entity} {parents spouse children}-- they cannot be exist on their own
Employye has dependents -- employee

Attributes -- name
Composite Attribute -- combintaion of attribiutes --> Address {street city state country}
multivalue Attributes --> like phoneNumber can have multiple values
Derived Attribute -- Age is derived from DOB

Relationships
one-to-one
one-many
many to one
many to many

Normalization -
Normalization generally involves splitting a table into multiple ones which must be linked
 each time a query is made requiring data from the split tables
 Primary objective is to elimnate anomalies ,redundancy

Anomalies
Inertion -- For example, if a database requires that every record has a primary key,
but no value is provided for a particular record, it cannot be inserted into the database.
Deletion - For example, if a database contains information about customers and orders, deleting a customer record
may also delete all the orders associated with that customer
Updation - if a database contains information about employees and their salaries, updating an employeeâ€™s salary in one record but not in all related records could lead to incorrect calculations and reporting.
