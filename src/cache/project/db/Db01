Why chose PostgreSQL over MySQL because it gives me richer features like JSONB indexing,
window functions, and stronger concurrency support.
This flexibility helps us model both structured and semi-structured product data efficiently.

Sql is owned bu oracle not completely free

In postgres -- we have features with rdbms + semi structured dat in jsonb format , Ai features ike pgvector and PostGIS, cte
CTEs (Common Table Expressions), Window Functions, Array types: useful for complex reporting, filters
Better Concurrency
PostgreSQL uses MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control)
Less locking issues vs MySQL (especially before InnoDB improvements)

Extensibility for AI/Future
PostgreSQL supports pgvector → for AI embeddings / recommendations
Supports PostGIS for geo data (good for delivery/logistics)
Can write custom functions in PL/pgSQL, Python, etc.
