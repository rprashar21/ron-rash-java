package datastructures.linkedlists;

public class SampleLinkedList {

    // linked list holds data and address
    /*
       dynamic ,, we dont need to know the size
       they need more memoy becoz they have to store the addresses
       advantage ,, there cannot be any holes hence no shifting
    *       find first item -- o(1)
    *      search any other item -- o(n)
    *      insert at beginning 0(1)
    *      insert at any other position o(n)
    *     delete at begining  -- 0(i)
    *    delete at any other postion --- 0(n)
    *
    *BUT IN JAVA'S LINKED LIST, THERE IS A REFERENCE TO THE LAST NODE OF THE LINKED LIST AS WELL !!!

    It means of course that inserting items to the end of the linked list
    (and removing items from the end of a linked list) takes O(1) constant running time complexity.

    Also we should always code by Interface
    If you have declared a List, you can later change it from ArrayList to LinkedList any time you want to.

    List<Integer> integerList = new ArrayList<>(); or U cna use LinkedList
