    // Real Life Analogy
    //A rocket launch waits for 3 services to report "ready": Fuel system, Navigation system, and Communication system. Only after all report ready, the rocket can launch.
    //This is exactly what CountDownLatch helps us simulate.

    // | Method                  | Description                          |
    //| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
    //| `new CountDownLatch(n)` | Initializes the latch with count `n` |
    //| `countDown()`           | Decrements the count by 1            |
    //| `await()`               | Blocks until the count reaches 0     |
