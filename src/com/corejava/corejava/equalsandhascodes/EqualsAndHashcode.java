  *  // A hashcode is an integer which is unique to an object/ instance .
    // when an object or instance is created a hashcode is assigned to it nd this hashcode tells us
    // whether multiple references  are pointing to a single instance or not
    //It's a mechanism for comparison, in other words. This really is like an address for a house,

* , object references are pointers or memory addresses that point to the location of an object in memory.
*  when u create an object a memory refernce is created
* The primary purpose of a hash code is to provide a way to efficiently organize objects in data structures like hash tables and hash maps.
*  Hash codes are used as keys to determine where objects should be stored in these data structures.
