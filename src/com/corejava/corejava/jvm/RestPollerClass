This sets up a RestPoller instance for polling a REST endpoint repeatedly until a condition is met.

Uses exponential backoff, meaning:1st retry will be shorter
it uses math delay = basedelay*Math.pow(attempt-1)
exponentialBaseDelayMs = 10
Poll Attempt #	Formula	Delay (ms)
1	10 × 2^(1 - 1) = 10 × 1	10
2	10 × 2^(2 - 1) = 10 × 2	20
3	10 × 2^(3 - 1) = 10 × 4	40
4	10 × 2^(4 - 1) = 10 × 8	80
5	10 × 2^(5 - 1) = 10 × 16	160

Each time, it doubles the wait time — that's exponential growth

Helps reduce system load during retries
Avoids hammering the server with too many requests
Ideal for testing async systems where results take time (like queues, background jobs)
