    // inteface blueprint of class -- 100% abstraction and multiple inheitance also an is-a relationship

    // all methods are public and abstract by default and data members are public static final
    // after java 8 we can have default and static methods in an interface
    // Java 9, we can have private methods in an interface.

    //Why interface 100% abstraction , multiple inheritance and loose coupling
    // in java 8 we can have default methods or methods can have body but need to have default keyword
    // why do we need this default method -- this is used so that any class that implements the interface can have their own implementation
    // the interface does not force it upon all the impementation classes
