    // the real meaning of abstarction is hiding complex details
    // it focuses on Focus on interface, not implementation

    // when to use
//    For defining contracts (interface, abstract class)
//
//    For service layers, APIs, drivers, strategy patterns

    // why abstraction --> where we cannot descibe what specific type it is like an animal --octupus/tiger both are animals and
    // java allows to group certain charesteristics into a group called abstraction

    // the base class is usually an abstract cncept-- the main purpose of the abstract class is to define behaviour its subclasses wil have
    // so it always participates in inheritance

    //A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class.
    // abstarct class can have constructors because its subclasses will use that to initialize its data members
    // It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.
    // If there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.
    // If you are extending an abstract class that has an abstract method, you must either provide the implementation of the method or make this class abstract.
    // abstract class can also be used to provide some implementation of the interface.
//
//    An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
//    It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
//    It cannot be instantiated.
//    It can have constructors and static methods also.
//    It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

    // if a class has an abstract method the class should be abstract

    // Diff betwee abstract and interface

    // inside interface every var is public static final      |       we can decalre var and methods in abstract
    // method is public and abstarct                          |   can be abstarct or non abstarct
    // cannot have constructors                               |   can have construtors
    // we cannot have static or instance blocks               |   we can ave
    // can refer lambdas                                      |   cannot refer lambdas
    // we canot override OBJECT CLASS METHOD                  | WE CAN OVERRIDE OBJECT CLASS METHODS
