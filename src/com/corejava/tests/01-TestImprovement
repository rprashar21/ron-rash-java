Static blocks and static fields are initialized when the class is loaded, which can add overhead if the initialization is heavy.
Use @BeforeAll or @AfterAll for setup and cleanup that is shared across all tests, rather than static blocks.

static key word
Performance:
✅ Zero object allocation per blob
✅ No garbage collection pressure
✅ Minimal memory footprint
✅ Faster execution (no constructor calls)

There will be no overhead or instance creation so
/ Static: 0 objects created
   // Instance: 100+ objects created and garbage collected

 Scalability
 Azure Functions can process hundreds of blobs concurrently
 Static methods scale better under load
 No object pool management needed
