Kubeconfig -- a file which has information to access the kubernetes cluster
docker ps --

when we want to create any kubernetes resource object we use the command
for example to create a pod
 kubectl create -f pod.yml
kubectl is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
create is the action to create a Kubernetes resource.
-f specifies that you are providing a file.
pod.yml is the YAML file containing the configuration for the pod you want to create.

And on all these nodes
we'll have the container runtime installed.


 Services in kubernets
 In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction layer that provides a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of Pods in a cluster.
 It acts as a load balancer, routing traffic to the appropriate Pod based on labels associated with the Pods.

 A Service consists of two parts: a set of Pods and a label selector. The label selector defines the group of Pods that the Service will route traffic to.
  When you create a Service, Kubernetes creates an endpoint object that includes the IP addresses of the Pods that match the label selector.


apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
