The whole idea is to automate the entire process of provisioning servers
Terraform is used for Infrastructure as code.
provision software/servers  on the cloud.
You can provision/provide virtual servers, load balancers, provide storage,databases.
you can create a number of resources in the cloud,like virtual servers, load balancers,databases, networking configuration,
using terraform configuration


Typically, TerraForm is used to do server provisioning.

Ansible is used for maintaining/configuration of the software on cloud

TerraForm --
1.terrform init --- downloads the plugins for aws,google

2. creating Iam user in aws -> also setting up the environment variables
   

3. Create s3 buckets
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_s3_bucket_rondev" { --> this is the internal name which we use in the terraform
 bucket = "my-s3-bucket-rondev"  -->this is the name in aws cloud
}

In terraform when we want to execute a command it is 2 step process
1. Plan -- to check what would happen if we exceute the command  -- terraform plan
2. execute -- execute the plan                                   -- terraform apply
3 states -Desired -- what we want  that is what we write in
          Know -- what we have in backupfile
          actual -- whatever is the state in aws

We understood the importance of TerraForm.tfstate, and we understood the fact that in TerraForm,
there are three different kinds of state - the desired state, which is actually defined in the terraform configuration files.

The known state - which is present in the tfstate files,
and the actual state which is actually the state of a specific resource on the cloud, on AWS.


 commands executed in TerraForm
brew install terraform
terraform --version
terraform version
terraform init
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=*******
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=*********
terraform plan
terraform console
terraform apply -refresh=false -- when we do not want the states to be refereshed
terraform plan -out iam.tfplan  -- when we ant to store the plan to an output file
terraform apply "iam.tfplan"    -- applying a specific plan
terraform apply -target=aws_iam_user.my_iam_user --apply a specific resource becoz we know what has changed
terraform destroy -- once everything is used you can destroy the resources
terraform validate
terraform fmt
terraform show
export TF_VAR_iam_user_name_prefix = FROM_ENV_VARIABLE_IAM_PREFIX
export TF_VAR_iam_user_name_prefix=FROM_ENV_VARIABLE_IAM_PREFIX
