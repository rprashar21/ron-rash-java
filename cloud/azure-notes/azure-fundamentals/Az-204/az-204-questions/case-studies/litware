  Box 2: var x = new BlobEncryptionPolicy(key,resolver);
  Example:
  // We begin with cloudKey1, and a resolver capable of resolving and caching Key Vault secrets.
  BlobEncryptionPolicy encryptionPolicy = new BlobEncryptionPolicy(cloudKey1, cachingResolver);
  client.DefaultRequestOptions.EncryptionPolicy = encryptionPolicy;
