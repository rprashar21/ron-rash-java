 1.Due to the nature of flash sales on the platform,
  there are unpredictable bursts of incoming requests,
  and you are concerned about overwhelming the function.
  You decide to ensure your function is optimized to handle such bursts without running into scalability issues.

  host.json file contains global configuration options that affect the behavior of the function app.

  "dynamicThrottlesEnabled" is set to true, it allows the function to respond to throttle events from the dynamic threads.concurrency feature.
   This is useful in scenarios where there are sudden and unpredictable bursts of incoming requests,
    as the function can automatically adjust based on current conditions.

  maxOutstandingRequests -- maximum number of outstanding requests that can be held at any given time
  functionTimeout - specifies the duration a function is allowed to run before it's timed out
  maxConcurrentRequests - no of reuquest that can be run by the function concurrently
