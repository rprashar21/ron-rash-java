Azure Functions is a serverless compute service, code first imperative
Azure Logic Apps is a serverless workflow integration platform, design first declarative

Function code files are stored on Azure Files shares on the function's main storage account.

When you create a function app in Azure, you must choose a hosting plan for your app.
3 plans
Consumption Plan - default, pay-as-u-go, only pay for compute resource running ur function app,
                   function host are added removed based on no of incoming events
                   Event driven . They scale automatically based on periods of hig load
                   1.5 gb memory with one cpu -- all function apps share this
Premium Plan -   pre-warmed workers which run the app with no delay,
                  runs on pwerful instances ,connect to virtual networks
Dedicated Plan - if ur using any app service plan u can use this as well .
best for long running scenarios , Durable functions cannot be used.

2 other hoisting plans where control and isolation is best
ASE - App service env is an app service feature ,, provides a full isolated,dedicated env at high scale -- manual
Kubernetes(direct or Azure Arc) - same on kubernetes platfrom  -- event driven

Azure Virtual Network (VNet) for secure and reliable network connectivity to Azure resources.
Premium plan: EP1, EP2, EP3
Standard App Service plan: S1
Premium App Service plan: P1V2, P2V2, P3V2, P1V3, P2V3, P3V3
Isolated App Service plan: I1, I2, I3, I1V2, I2V2, I3V2
Does not support:

Free App Service plan: F1
Shared App Service plan: D1
Basic App Service plan: B1, B2, B3



Consumption Plan	Serverless, auto-scaling, pay-per-use,
cold starts possible	Event-driven or infrequent workloads
Image processing triggered by blob uploads

Premium Plan	Serverless, no cold starts, VNET support, and dedicated instances
                Consistent performance, secure VNET access
                Real-time order processing in an e-commerce site

Dedicated (App Service) Plan	Runs on an App Service Plan with manual scaling and long-running support
	                  Long-running functions or existing App Service usage	Data aggregation that takes a long time

Kubernetes-based Plan (AKS)	Runs on AKS, full Kubernetes control
Integration into microservices or advanced scaling
 IoT data processing within a microservices architecture

App Service Plan	Runs on dedicated instances with full control, supports always-on, and long-running functions
When consolidating resources for web apps and functions, or when predictable workloads need consistent performance	Running a batch processing job that takes longer than 10 minutes, or using shared resources between web apps and functions

Explanation for App Service Plan:
Description: Runs on a dedicated App Service Plan, providing full control over scaling, instance size, and always-on capability.
 Functions run continuously, avoiding cold starts, and are suitable for long-running tasks.

When to Use: Ideal for consolidating resources when you already have web apps running on an App Service Plan or
when you need to run long-running functions that exceed the timeout limits of other plans.
Example Scenario:
Data Processing Job: A batch job that processes data every night and runs for over 10 minutes.
 The App Service Plan ensures the function runs without timing out.
Shared Resources for Web Apps and Functions: Deploying functions alongside a web app on the same App Service Plan to manage inventory or order processing tasks efficiently using shared resources.


Function app timeout duration
property - functionTimeout in host.json --> function needs to respond within this time

plan           default    max
consumption     5         10     mins
premium         30       unlimited
dedicated      30        unlimited


==================================================================
Runtime scaling
Azure Functions use scale controller to monitor whether to sacle in or out.
eg Azure Queue trigger -- scales based on queue length and age of oldest message

input bindings
Webhooks,event hubs,blob stroage queie,timer ---> increase no of events
--scale controller -- increase funct app instances
the platfrom may scale to 0 if nothing is there

Scaling behaviors
A single function app can scale to 200 instances , no limit for concurrent msgs
HTTP triggers, new instances are allocated per second
Non Http Triggers new instances are allocated per 30 second


functionAppScaleLimit value. limit the no of instances a function app can scale
0 or null for unrestricted, or a valid value between 1 and the app maximum.


Azure Functions hosting plans is best when predictive scaling and costs ie dedicated

===========================================================================
Azure functions functions.json file
2 imp peices code and config file

function.json file
{
"disabled":false
 "bindings":[
     // ..... all the bindings are here
     {
         "type": "bindingType",
         "direction": "in",     Indicates whether the binding is for receiving data into the function or sending data from the function.
           "name": "myParamName",
                     // ... more depending on binding
     }
    ]
}

A function app is an execution context in Azure in which your functions run.
all functions inside this share same pricing plans ,runtime version  deployment method

host.json file contains runtime-specific configurations and is in the root folder of the function app.
A bin folder contains packages and other library files

===========================================================================
Binding direction
triggers cause the function to run , only one trigger
All triggers and bindings have a direction property in the function.json file:

triggers always have in direcion
input and output have in and out
there is inout also If you use inout, only the Advanced editor is available via the Integrate tab in the portal.

===========================================================================
Scenario
where a queuetrigger reads data from a Azure Queue Storage and makes a row entry in azure storage
 function.json file for this scenario.
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "order", // function parameter that receives the queue message content
      "queueName": "myqueue-items", the queue which the trigger monitors
      "connection": "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
    },
    {
      "type": "table", output
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return", // property specifies how the function provides the new table row
      "tableName": "outTable",
      "connection": "MY_TABLE_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
    }
  ]
}
