apiVersion: v1 -- This is the kubernetes api  being used
kind: pod  -> this defines the resource which is being created
metadata:   --> information about our pod
  name: nginx-pod  --> name of the pod which will be created
  labels:  --> assign labels to our pods which will be used for identifying pods latser
    app: nginx
    tier: dev
  namespace: ns-dev
spec:   --> Describes the desired state of our pods ,
  containers: --> specifies the array of containers to run inside the pod ,, here we have one
    - name: container-nginx-name --> name of our container
      image: nginx   -> name of our image
      ports:
       -containerPort: 80 --> application inside a pod is runnig on this port 80

kubectl get pods    ---> to see the pods
kubectl get pods -o wide --> to see additional details
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> ---> to see details like node assignment , image
kubeclt delete pod <pod-name>

What does the READY column in the output of the kubectl get pods command indicate?
running containers in a pod / total containers in a pod

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: my-nginx
 labels:
  app: nginx
  tier: dev
spec:
 containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
    ports:
     - containerPort: 80

kubectl apply -f redis.yml


Pods are the smallest deployable unit where our containers are deployed.
One to one relationship with containers ,,
it can have multiple different containers like a frontendPod can have 2 separate containers for a 2 diff frontend applications
there are helper containers -- DataPuller,Pushers Proxies  --> these containers cannot exist independantly and hence they are need sometimes

Create a pod in declarative way
kubectl run <desired-pod-name> --image <Container-Image>
kubectl run my-first-pod --image stacksimplify/kubenginx:1.0.0

what does this command do ??
kubernetes will create a pod ,, pull the image from docker and create a container inside the pod and start it

to access our application from outside we need to create a loadbalancer service
Expose pod with a service (Load Balancer Service) to access the application externally (from internet)

Creating a pod
kubectl run my-first-pod --image stacksimplify/kubenginx:1.0.0

Expose Pod as a Service
kubectl expose pod <Pod-Name>  --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --name=<Service-Name>
kubectl expose pod my-first-pod --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --name=loadbalancerservice

manifest file for a

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp1-loadbalancer
  labels:
    app: myapp1 --> this should match the label of the pod
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer  -->Specifies the type of Service. In this case, it's "LoadBalancer," which means that the Kubernetes cluster should provision an external load balancer to route traffic to the Service.
  selector:  identifies which pods it should route traffic to in this case the pod name is myapp1
    app: myapp1
  ports: -->  Specifies an array of port mappings for the Service.
    - port: 80  -->Sets the port on which the Service will listen. In this case, it's port 80, which is a common HTTP port.
      targetPort: 80 --> port on which y container is running, incoming traffic should run on this port

The external load balancer will be provisioned to distribute incoming traffic on port 80 to the Pods with the label "app: myapp1."

# Get Service Info
kubectl get service
kubectl get svc

# Describe Service
kubectl describe service my-first-service

# Access Application
http://<External-IP-from-get-service-output>

Interact with Pods
# Get Pod Name
kubectl get pod-name

# Dump Pod logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs my-first-pod

# Stream pod logs with -f option and access application to see logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs -f my-first-pod

what is running inside our pod now ??
it is a nginx container , lets interact with that
# Connect to Nginx Container in a POD
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod -- /bin/bash

# Execute some commands in Nginx container
ls
cd /usr/share/nginx/html
cat index.html
exit

# Sample Commands
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod -- env
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod -- ls
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
kubectl -it exec pod-name sh --> attach sh to the pod
ls   --> now execute commands in this pod



Get yaml configuration for our pod and service
# Get pod definition YAML output
kubectl get pod my-first-pod -o yaml

# Get service definition YAML output
kubectl get service my-first-service -o yaml


# Get all Objects in default namespace
kubectl get all

# Delete Services
kubectl delete svc my-first-service

# Delete Pod
kubectl delete pod my-first-pod

# Get all Objects/resoureces  in default namespace
kubectl get all
