helm search repo
helm search wordpress
helm search the hub
helm search hub nginx

traffic --> servvice{load balancer}--> pod, replica3 of nginx server

install wordpress
helm search hub
helm search hub nginx
helm repo add bitnami url --> first we need to install the bitnami and then do a search -- we install this repo which is actually a metadata and not a repo

helm pull bitnami/nginx --untar=true --> puling nginx image


helm install <name >bitnami/nginx  --> install ing nginx
# this will  deploy all the mainfest files
