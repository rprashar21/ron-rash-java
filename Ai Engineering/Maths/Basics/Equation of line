Equation of line
y=mx+c this is the equation of a straight line

y: the output (what you're trying to find or predict)
x: the input (what you already know)
m: the slope (how much 𝑦 changes with x)
c: the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)


Real Life Example
imagine u get 10 res from ur parents every day ,,now plot a graph --
On Day 1, you have ₹10
On Day 2, you have ₹20
On Day 3, you have ₹30


x = number of days
y = total pocket money

You’re gaining ₹10 per day, so the equation becomes:
y=10x+0

m=10: you earn ₹10 each day (slope)
c=0: you started with ₹0 (no starting amount)

After 1 day: y=10(1)+0=10
after 3 days: y=10(3)+0=30

m	Tells you how fast things are changing (rate or slope)
c	Tells you where you started (the beginning value when
y	The result/output you're calculating
x	The input/independent value

y = mx + c" tells you how something grows or changes over time, starting from a specific point and moving at a steady rate.

if u look a the png u will see an equation of line
y=mx+c -->
x-axis: time in hours 🕒
y-axis: distance traveled in kilometers 🚴‍♂️
Slope (m = 5): You travel 5 km every hour.
Intercept (c = 2): You already traveled 2 km before you started timing.
