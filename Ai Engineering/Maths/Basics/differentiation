Differentiation tells you how fast something is changing.

The distance you travel changes over time.
The speedometer tells you how fast you're going right now


Let’s say you’re tracking how many pizzas you’ve delivered:

At 1 PM: 10 pizzas
At 2 PM: 25 pizzas
At 3 PM: 40 pizzas

Your speed of delivery (rate) is increasing!

Between 1–2 PM: 25-10/2-1 =15 pizzas/hour

Between 2–3 PM: 40-25/3-1 =15 pizzas/hour

If you take the derivative of your delivery count over time, it tells you how fast you're delivering pizzas at any moment

y=f(x)


Differentiation is SUPER important In Ml because:
Models learn by minimizing error using techniques like gradient descent
Gradient = the derivative of the error function
It tells the model which direction to move the weights to improve performance
