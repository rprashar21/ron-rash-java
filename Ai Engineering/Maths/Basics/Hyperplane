In machine learning, we use hyperplanes to separate different kinds of data.

Imagine you're training a robot to recognize:
🐱 Cats
🐶 Dogs
You give it data: size, ear shape, tail length, etc.
The algorithm finds a hyperplane that splits cat data on one side, dog data on the other.
Then for new data, it checks which side of the hyperplane it falls on — and predicts the label.

Let’s say the equation is: 𝑤x + b =0

Then:
If result > 0 → it's on one side (maybe a dog)
If result < 0 → it's on the other side (maybe a cat)
If result = 0 → it's exactly on the hyperplane

==========

So basically A hyperplane is just like a line or plane, but it lives in more dimensions — like 4D, 5D, or more.

The equation stays the same pattern:


             Where:

             𝑤 ->w is a vector of weights (like [2, -3, 1])
             x is a data point (like [5, 1, 7])
             b is the biad ⋅ means dot product
