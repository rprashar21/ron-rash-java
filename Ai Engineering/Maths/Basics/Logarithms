A logarithm is just a fancy way to ask: 👉 "How many times do I multiply a number to get another number?"

Let’s say you have a magic number 2. You want to find out how many times you need to multiply it to get 8.

log2(8)=3 ie u multiply 2 ,3 times to get to 8

Read as: "Log base 2 of 8 equals 3.

Where is it useful ??
Instead of writing 1,000,000, we can write log(1,000,000) = 6, making things simpler

Solving for Time or Steps ⏳
If you want to know how long it takes to double your money in a bank, logs help calculate that.


So if we take time complexity
log(n)-- How many times do I need to search to reach a certain number ?" → That’s log(n)
Imagine you have a book with 1,000,000 pages, and you need to find one special page. Instead of flipping through one by one, you

Open the middle page. If the special page is before it, ignore the right half.
Open the middle of the remaining pages.
Keep cutting the pages in half until you find it.

This takes only ~20 steps instead of 1,000,000!
That’s log(n) time complexity!
log(n)

log(n) means cutting the problem in half each time!

If n = 1,000, log(1000) is about 10
If n = 1,000,000, log(1,000,000) is about 20
It grows very slowly, making it super efficient!

So O(n log n) (QuickSort, MergeSort)

   You divide the problem log n times (just like Binary Search).
   But at each step, you process all n elements.
   Example: Sorting 1,000,000 numbers using QuickSort or MergeSort → takes about 20×1,000,000 = 20,000,000 steps.

Comparison
Complexity	What It Does	Example	Steps for n = 1,000,000
O(log n)	Divides problem each step	Binary Search	20 steps
O(n log n)	Divides & processes each item	QuickSort/MergeSort	~20,000,000 steps
QuickSort & MergeSort (Why O(n log n))?
📌 Step 1: Divide the array in half → log n times
📌 Step 2: Process each number at every division → O(n)
📌 Total Work Done = O(n log
