What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm that tries to find the best straight line
(in 2D, a plane in higher dimensions) that fits through a set of data points.

It answers the question:
"Can I predict one thing (like weight) based on another (like height) using a straight line?

Example Data
Height(cm)     weight(kg)
160	            55
165	            58
170	            62

You can see that taller people usually weigh more
If someone is 172 cm tall, I predict they weigh about 65 k

Plot the graph and try to see if u get a sort of linear
y=mx+c or y=wx+b
x = input (height)
y= predicted output (weight)
w = slope (how much weight changes with height)
b = bias (intercept, where the line starts)

How it works
Input: A bunch of known examples (height â†’ weight)
Model: Linear equation
Goal: Find the line that minimizes the error between predicted and actual weights
Training: Uses math (least squares or gradient descent) to reduce that error
