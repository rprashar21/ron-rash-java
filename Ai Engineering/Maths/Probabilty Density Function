 A probability density function (PDF) is a mathematical function that describes the relative likelihood of a continuous
 random variable taking on a specific value.
 However, for continuous random variables, the probability of the variable being exactly any single value is technically zero.
 Instead, the PDF helps determine the probability that the variable falls within a certain interval.

 Example
 Imagine you're picking candies from a jar, and the PDF tells you that most candies are red.
  So, if you take a handful, you’re more likely to get red candies.

In Machine Learning:
When computers learn from data, they sometimes use PDFs to understand how likely different outcomes are.
if a computer is trying to guess someone's height, it might use a PDF to figure out that most people are around a certain height, and fewer people are very short or very tall.


What is PMF CDF AND PDF
PMF -- > Probablity Mass Function
A function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to a specific value.
Example : rolling a dice what is the probablity that any number x is a specific value is 1/6

CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function):
A function that gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a specific value.
Example: For the same die roll, the CDF for x=3 is:
F(3)=P(X≤3)=P(X=1)+P(X=2)+P(X=3)= =0.5

So, there is a 50% chance that the die roll will result in a number 3 or less

In short, the PMF tells you the probability of each specific outcome, while the CDF tells you the probability of the outcome being at or below a certain value.


A Probability Density Function (PDF) is similar to a Probability Mass Function (PMF) but is used for continuous random variables instead of discrete ones
 PDF shows how "dense" the probability is around that value
 it will show what is the probablity that a randow variable will fall within a range

 To find the probability that the spinner lands between 0.2 and 0.5, calculate the area under the curve from 0.2 to 0.5:

 There are 2 types of PDF Probability Density Function
 Parameteric and Non Parameteric

 Parametric -- it measure what is the probability of a continuoss random variable will fall within a range
