Normal Distribution for Probabilty Density Estimation

Imagine you randomly scoop ice cream and measure 1000 scoops.
Some are 48g, some are 52g, and most are close to 50g.

Now, we calculate:

Average scoop weight (Mean): → 50g
Variation in scoops (Standard Deviation): → 5g
This means most scoops are between 45g and 55g, but a few might be 40g or 60g.

from scipy.stats import norm

# Find the mean and std of existing scoops
mean_scoop = sample.mean()  # Average scoop weight (e.g., 50g)
std_scoop = sample.std()    # Variation in scoop weight (e.g., 5g)

# Fit a normal distribution model
dist = norm(mean_scoop, std_scoop)

We now have a "pattern" (mathematical model) that describes how our scoops behave.

Predicting Future Scoops
Now that we have this fitted distribution dist, we can generate new ice cream scoops that follow the same pattern.

# Generate 5 future scoops
new_scoops = dist.rvs(size=5)
print(new_scoops)

[51.2, 48.5, 50.7, 52.3, 47.8]
Each new scoop follows the same pattern as the original ones.

Why is This Useful?
Prediction: If tomorrow we scoop more ice cream, we now know that most scoops will be around 50g ± 5g.
Quality Control: If a scoop is way too big (70g) or too small (30g), we know it’s not normal and should be fixed.
Decision Making: If customers complain about small scoops, we can adjust the recipe to make sure scoops are always close to 50g.

When we say "Fit a Normal Distribution to Predict Future Scoops", we mean:

Find the pattern (mean & std deviation).
Use that pattern to generate future values.
Ensure the new scoops follow the same behavior as past ones.
This concept applies to heights of people, exam scores, cricket runs, or stock prices—anywhere you want to understand data trends and predict future values!
