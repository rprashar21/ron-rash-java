Step-by-Step Answering Template
Set the Stage ‚Äî What‚Äôs the Problem or Need?

Goal: Show the why behind the system.
Say:
‚ÄúAt the UK Ministry of Justice,
 we needed a way to allow legal teams to quickly query large legal case files (IDPCs)
 and extract structured insights like weapons used, victim injuries, and prior convictions.
 Manually searching PDFs was slow, error-prone, and inconsistent.‚Äù
 This system appears to be designed for legal professionals to quickly search and get AI-assisted answers from case documents,
  helping them find relevant information efficiently while maintaining accuracy through source citations.

Specifi info from the documents
reduce human error, increase efficeincy , context aware,
summarize the documents ,extract key information , timeline , descrepancy of the witness statemenst
chronlogy of the events ,statemnets

2.Scope the System ‚Äî What Should It Do?

‚ÄúThe system had to:
Ingest IDPC documents from Azure Blob

Extract structured sections (e.g., Witness Statements, Forensic Reports) using DocumentIntelligence

Chunk them meaningfully using semantic logic -- LangChain4j comes into picture
Create vector embeddings and index in Azure AI Search
Allow users to query via a chatbot and get grounded, structured answers with citations.‚Äù


The flow is as follows
he flow starts when:

A case is listed in the Magistrates‚Äô Court.
It could be submitted by:
SPI ‚Äì Police Prosecutors

CPPI ‚Äì Non-Police Prosecutors

MCC ‚Äì Manual Case Creators

The system checks:
Does this case involve a new IDPC document?
Is the court house enabled for the AI feature rollout?
Has the document already been processed?
üîπ If all conditions are met:

The IDPC document is sent to the AI Document Ingestion & Query Service, which breaks down the legal document,
extracts key facts (like weapons used or injuries), and makes them queryable via a chatbot.
