public ResponseEntity<User> getUserById(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
    // Code to retrieve user by ID
}

In Spring MVC, both @RestControllerAdvice and @ControllerAdvice are used to handle exceptions and apply global behavior to controllers.
 However, they have different purposes and are used in different scenarios:

In summary, @ControllerAdvice is used for traditional Spring MVC applications where the response can be in various formats,
 while @RestControllerAdvice is used specifically for RESTful APIs, where the response is typically in JSON format.
