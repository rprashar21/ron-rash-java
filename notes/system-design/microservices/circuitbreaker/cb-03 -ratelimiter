What Is Redis Rate Limiter in Spring Cloud Gateway?
Spring Cloud Gateway uses Redis to store request counts for each client/IP/key and allows or blocks requests based on configured limits per time window.
Itâ€™s often implemented using Token Bucket Algorithm internally

Why we use it
Scalable, distributed rate limiting (unlike in-memory)
Helps prevent abuse, DoS, API spamming
Works well in Kubernetes / stateless environments
Easy integration with Spring Cloud Gateway
