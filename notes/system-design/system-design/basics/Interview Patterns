Thank you fo rthe quesition before we start designing our system
I would like to lcarify some question about the platform

e. what is our targted audience/users
Audience / Users
1.Who is this system for?
Legal analysts, customer support agents, doctors, or general enterprise users?
Is the target audience global or restricted to a specific region (e.g., UK-only)?

2. Problem We’re Solving
What pain point are we addressing?
Example: Analysts spend hours searching documents → RAG reduces this to seconds.
Users want trustworthy answers with citations, not hallucinations.

3.Constraints / Resistance Points --> Compliance GDPR, latencey response cost of llm accuracy hallucaintion
4. Impcat we have - pro - Faster research, cost savings, better decision-making.
negative - Wrong answers could harm trust, hallucinations could mislead, cost overruns if not optimized.


5. Success Metrics - customer satisfaction ,accurate ,faster data,  User trust (answers backed by citations
Definition of Success
A system that is: acurate ,relaiblae trustworthy scalabel
Accurate (retrieves the right context),
Reliable (low latency, high availability),
Trustworthy (grounded answers with citations),
Scalable (can grow from 10K to 100K docs/day).

6. Feasibility / Cost / Infrastructure
Can this be built cost-effectively with existing infra?
Embeddings → Vector DB → LLM inference.
Consider cloud costs (storage, embeddings, queries).
Need rate limiting + batching to keep infra feasible.
