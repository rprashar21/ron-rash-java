Cap Theorem
Consistent -- every read recives the most recent write (no stale data ) --
      example -->If you update your Instagram profile picture, all friends see the new picture instantly
               we can comprose on this sometimes due to eventual consistency

 Availability -- every request will give u some response , the system is always up
                Instagram always loads something for you, even during high traffic.
                like fault tolerannce --even when a ms is down it gives u some reponse

Partituion Tolerance -- Eben when there are netwrok failure and the systems are not able to talk to each other, the application still operates
Even if one Instagram data center loses connectivity, the rest still work.

In a distributed system, Partition Tolerance (P) is non-negotiable — networks can and do fail.
CP → Consistency + Partition Tolerance
AP → Availability + Partition Tolerance

Imagine two banks on different islands (nodes) that must keep balances in sync:

CP: If the cable between islands is cut, they stop transactions to avoid mismatch.
AP: They keep processing locally, but balances might mismatch and later need fixin

Consistency: All nodes see the same data at the same time.
Availability: Every request gets a response, even if some nodes fail.
Partition Tolerance: The system functions despite network partitions (communication failures between nodes).
