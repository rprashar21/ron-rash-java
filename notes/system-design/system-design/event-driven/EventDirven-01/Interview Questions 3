How do you synchronize read and write models?
The cqrs makes ure the commadn and query are separate ,
The command handler will handle the payload , it willl convert the payload into domain object
it will load the the entire evnt stream based on the stream id / unique id for a case
it may genererate new events which are stored in the event store
they are consumed by the event listeners to update the read projections (stored in the view store)

there is no direct synchronization between the read and write model , we depend upon eventual consistency
There is no direct synchronization — instead, we rely on eventual consistency.
The read model eventually reflects the write model once the event has been processed.

For critical user flows, we apply polling with retry logic (Fibonacci/exponential backoff) to ensure the data is
available before responding to the user.”


How do you replay events for a corrupted case?
Each aggregate (e.g., a case) has a dedicated event stream. If we detect data corruption or need to investigate a bug,
we can replay the stream by fetching all events using the stream ID (like Case-UUID) and reapplying them to reconstruct the state.

We also support partial replays — e.g., from a certain event onwards —
and have a utility endpoint to trigger replays in dev/stage environments.
In production, we run replays manually after isolating the impacted case IDs.
