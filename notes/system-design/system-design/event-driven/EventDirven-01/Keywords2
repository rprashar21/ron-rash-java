This will deal with 2ndpart of the flow from the commadn handler to the processor

what is an event store ??
its like a database , but instead of storing the current state ,it stores a sequence of domain events
the source of truth is the list of events ,not rows in tables
example
HearingId: 123
- HearingCreated
- HearingScheduled
- HearingSequenced

Event stream is a list of events with a stream id/aggreagte id -- usually the hearing id ,,
You load all events from this stream to reconstruct the aggregate

what is Aggregate
It is a domain object the encapsulates the business logic and state
REbuilt from the event stream
Has internal state like date, courtId, sequence
Exposes methods like scheduleHearing() or sequenceHearingDays()

UPstream --> The system or service that sends the command or event
Downstream	The system that reacts to the event (e.g., sends email, updates search index)

In your example:
Command API is upstream
Event Processor + View Store + Notification Publisher = downstream
