One of the most powerful aspects of Event Sourcing: the ability to rebuild system state at any time by replaying stored events

What actually is replaying
Replaying the event store means using all historical events to reconstruct the current state of a domain object.
 You don’t store the object — you store how it became that object over time

what does repalying the event store mean ??
imagine ur service crashes or u change the business logic
1.Load all the events from the event store
2. reapply them in order
2. reconstruct the current state of the aggreagate object eg hearing

============= code example==

===== event model===========
interface event{}

class HearingCreated implements Event{
    String hearingId;
    HearingCreated(String hearingId)
    { this.hearingId = hearingId; }
}
class HearingScheduled implements Event {
    String courtId;
    String date;
    HearingScheduled(String courtId, String date) {
        this.courtId = courtId;
        this.date = date;
    }
}
----- eveny model -----

---  Aggregate – Hearing

public class Hearing {
    String hearingId;
    String courtId;
    String date;

    public static Hearing replay(List<Event> events) {
        Hearing h = new Hearing();
        for (Event e : events) {
            if (e instanceof HearingCreated ev) {
                h.hearingId = ev.hearingId;
            } else if (e instanceof HearingScheduled ev) {
                h.courtId = ev.courtId;
                h.date = ev.date;
            }
        }
        return h;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Hearing{" + "id=" + hearingId + ", courtId=" + courtId + ", date=" + date + "}";
    }
}
================

Simulate Event Store & Rebuild State

public class ReplayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulated event stream from event store
        List<Event> storedEvents = List.of(
            new HearingCreated("H123"),
            new HearingScheduled("C001", "2025-06-10")
        );

        // Rebuild the aggregate by replaying events
        Hearing rebuilt = Hearing.replay(storedEvents);

        System.out.println("✅ Rebuilt aggregate: " + rebuilt);
    }
}

== basically in this sample code you will load all the events and replay the event store

✅ Rebuilt aggregate: Hearing{id=H123, courtId=C001, date=2025-06-10}

Real World
Crash recovery: Lose in-memory state? Just replay
Recalculate state with new logic: Add logic to apply(...), replay all old events.
Debugging: Replay one user's stream to reproduce a bug.
Build projections: Create a new read model by consuming old events.
