pull the latest image for docker
docker pull elasticsearch:7.17.12

run docker as container
docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.17.12
docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.17.12

run a docker -d detached mode so that it is not attached to the terminal
runs on port 9200
-p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300:
These flags map ports from the host machine to ports in the container.
Elasticsearch uses port 9200 for its REST API and port 9300 for node-to-node communication.
This mapping allows you to access Elasticsearch externally via port 9200 and communicate between nodes using port 9300.

-e "discovery.type=single-node":
This sets an environment variable within the container.
In this case, it's configuring Elasticsearch to run in a single-node mode,
which simplifies the cluster setup for testing or development.

this is the response we get when we use localhost:9200

HEAD Method:
The HTTP HEAD method is a standard HTTP request method used to retrieve metadata about a resource without actually fetching the resource itself.
It's commonly used to check if a resource exists, retrieve information about it, or verify its status.

URL http://localhost:9200/product_index:
This URL is targeting an Elasticsearch index named product_index (or whatever index name you replace it with). The URL is formed based on the following components:

http://localhost:9200: The base URL of your Elasticsearch instance. By default, Elasticsearch's REST API runs on port 9200, and the localhost address is used when running Elasticsearch locally.
product_index: The name of the Elasticsearch index you want to interact with. An index in Elasticsearch is similar to a database table, and it stores the data you want to search and analyze.
So, when you send a HEAD request to http://localhost:9200/product_index, you are asking Elasticsearch for metadata about the product_index index, such as whether it exists or not.
