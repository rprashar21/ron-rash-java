This is not a typical Spring Boot application, but rather a more complex distributed system with:
CQRS architecture
Event-driven design
Microservices
Domain-driven design
Event sourcing
The tests are integration tests that verify the behavior of the entire system, including:
Command processing
Event handling
State changes
Document management
Case progression
Would you like me to:
Explain more about any specific aspect?
Show how the CQRS pattern is implemented?
Explain the event handling mechanism?
Discuss the testing strategy?
