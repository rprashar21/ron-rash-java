ActiveMQ Provides Messaging Infrastructure:

ActiveMQ is the software that handles the actual transfer of messages between the producer (who sends) and the consumer (who receives).
The connection URL (tcp://localhost:61616) specifies that the code connects to an ActiveMQ broker running locally on port 61616.
Queue and Topic Management:

ActiveMQ manages queues (point-to-point communication) and topics (publish-subscribe communication) where messages are stored and distributed.
Ensures Reliable Delivery:

It guarantees that messages sent by a producer are safely stored and delivered to consumers, even if the consumer is temporarily unavailable (e.g., in durable subscriptions).
Supports Multiple Protocols:

ActiveMQ supports multiple messaging protocols like JMS, MQTT, STOMP, AMQP, etc., making it versatile for integrating various systems.

How ActiveMQ Works in the Example
Producer Sends a Message:

The MessageProducer sends a message to a queue named "MyQueue".
ActiveMQ receives this message and stores it in its internal queue.
Consumer Receives the Message:

The MessageConsumer connects to the same queue ("MyQueue") and retrieves the message stored by ActiveMQ.

ActiveMq - Messages can be sent and received asynchronously, allowing applications to process messages without waiting.

Real-Life Example:
Imagine a food delivery app:

Producer: The restaurant sends an order update ("Order Ready") to a message queue.
ActiveMQ: The queue holds this message until the delivery driver (the consumer) retrieves it.
Consumer: The driver receives the update ("Order Ready") and picks up the food.
ActiveMQ ensures that messages are safely transferred, even if the driver app temporarily goes offline.
