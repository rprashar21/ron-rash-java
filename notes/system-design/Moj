Normal flow
Client -> Command API -> Command Queue -> Command Handler -> Event Stream -> Event Queue -> Event Processor -> View Store

Error Flow
Client -> Command API -> Command Queue -> Command Handler (Fails) -> DLQ -> Retry Mechanism -> Command Handler (Succeeds) -> Event Stream

Recovery Flow
DLQ -> Manual Review -> Reprocess -> Command Handler -> Event Stream -> Event Queue -> Event Processor -> View Store

ey Error Handling Features:
Resilience:
System continues operating despite failures
Graceful degradation
Automatic recovery
Data consistency maintained

Monitoring:
Queue health checks
Processing metrics
Error tracking
Performance monitoring

Recovery:
Automatic retries
Manual intervention options
State reconstruction
Data consistency checks

Audit:
Error logging
Event tracking
Retry history
Recovery actions
This system is designed to be resilient and
 handle errors gracefully while maintaining data consistency and providing clear recovery paths.
The combination of CQRS, event sourcing, and robust error handling makes it suitable for enterprise-level applications
where reliability is crucial.

Lets look at scalabilty
Command side can scale independently
Query side can scale independently
Event processors can be scaled separately
Each component can be deployed on multiple instances


  Command Side (Write Operations):
   - Optimized for consistency
   - Event sourcing for audit
   - Can handle high write loads
   - Distributed across multiple nodes

   Query Side (Read Operations):
   - Denormalized views for fast reads
   - Can be scaled horizontally
   - Cached frequently accessed data
   - Optimized for read performance

 What is unique about this architecture
 Separation of concerns the command query event processor
  Command Side:
    - Handles write operations
    - Maintains consistency
    - Processes business logic
    - Generates events

    Query Side:
    - Handles read operations
    - Optimized for speed
    - Denormalized data
    - Fast response times

  This architecture is particularly suitable for:
  High-volume court/justice systems
  Systems requiring audit trails
  Applications needing high availability
  Systems with complex business logic
  Applications requiring fast read operations
  Systems needing data consistency
  Applications with high scalability requirements
  The combination of CQRS, event sourcing, and message queuing makes this system capable of
  handling millions of requests while maintaining data consistency and providing fast response times. The architecture is designed for both scalability and reliability, which is crucial for a court/justice system
