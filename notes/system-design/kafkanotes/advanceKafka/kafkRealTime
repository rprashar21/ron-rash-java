Important factors for partition count and replication factors
partition can handle a thruput of a few mbs(measure it if you setup)
more partitions means better parallelism,thruput,mor consumers{a partition is assigned to one consumer in a grp}
we can have more brokers if you have more clusters


Guideline
Partitions per topic = Small cluster (<6 brokers): 3times(brokers) 18 partitions
big cluster 12 brokers == 2*brokers == 24 partitions
depends upon how many consumers you have

Chooes the replication factor ,, nver have 1 in production ,, min is 2 ,usually 2 4
(n-1 )
more replication will reduce lead to high latenct if acks=all

get started with 3 ,, if the replication factor is an issue get more brokers

if u need more partitions add clusters
