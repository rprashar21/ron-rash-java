To help you showcase the high-demand backend developer skills (Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, React, CI/CD, etc.) and address real-world problems like **scaling**, **performance**, **concurrency**, **metrics**, and **observability**, I’ll propose a **portfolio project** that you can build and host on GitHub. This project will tackle a realistic problem faced by high-growth startups and enterprises, incorporating end-to-end backend and frontend development, scalability patterns, and observability. I’ll also suggest how to contribute to open-source projects to enhance your visibility.

The project will be a **real-time e-commerce platform** (e.g., a simplified version of an Amazon-like system) that handles high traffic, concurrent users, and performance-critical operations. This allows you to demonstrate the 80/20 skills (Java, Spring Boot, microservices, Kubernetes, React, etc.) while solving a tangible problem. Below, I’ll outline the problem, the project architecture, key patterns, and implementation details, including code artifacts for critical components. I’ll also recommend open-source contributions aligned with your goals.

### Real-World Problem: Scalable E-Commerce Platform
**Problem Statement**:
A startup is building an e-commerce platform that must handle **10,000 concurrent users**, process **real-time inventory updates**, manage **user authentication**, and provide a **responsive frontend**. The system must scale seamlessly during peak traffic (e.g., Black Friday sales), maintain low-latency responses (<100ms for API calls), ensure **data consistency** across microservices, and provide **observability** to detect performance bottlenecks. Key challenges include:
- **Scalability**: Handle spikes in user traffic without downtime.
- **Performance**: Optimize API response times and database queries.
- **Concurrency**: Manage simultaneous user actions (e.g., placing orders, updating inventory).
- **Security**: Secure user data and transactions.
- **Observability**: Monitor system health, latency, and errors in real-time.
- **Deployment**: Automate deployments to minimize downtime and ensure reliability.

This problem mirrors what high-paying startups (e.g., Shopify, Stripe) and enterprises (e.g., Amazon) face, making it a perfect portfolio project to demonstrate your skills.

### Key Patterns and Techniques
To build a scalable, high-performance system, you’ll implement the following patterns:

1. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - Split the system into services (e.g., User Service, Product Service, Order Service, Inventory Service) to ensure modularity and scalability.
   - Use **Spring Cloud** for service discovery and configuration.

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Use **Kafka** for asynchronous communication (e.g., inventory updates after orders).
   - Ensures loose coupling and scalability under high load.

3. **Concurrency Control**:
   - Implement **optimistic locking** in Hibernate to handle concurrent order updates.
   - Use Redis for distributed locks in high-concurrency scenarios (e.g., flash sales).

4. **Caching**:
   - Use **Redis** to cache product catalog and user sessions, reducing database load.
   - Implement cache-aside pattern for performance.

5. **Database Optimization**:
   - Use **PostgreSQL** with indexes and partitioning for fast queries.
   - Denormalize data where necessary to avoid complex joins.

6. **Scalability**:
   - Deploy services on **Kubernetes** with horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) to handle traffic spikes.
   - Use **load balancing** (e.g., AWS ALB) to distribute traffic.

7. **Observability**:
   - Integrate **Spring Actuator** for health checks and metrics.
   - Use **Prometheus** to collect metrics and **Grafana** for dashboards (e.g., API latency, error rates).
   - Implement **distributed tracing** with Jaeger or Zipkin for debugging.

8. **Security**:
   - Secure APIs with **JWT** and **Spring Security**.
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., user info) using **AES**.

9. **CI/CD**:
   - Automate builds, tests, and deployments with **GitHub Actions**.
   - Use **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning on AWS.
